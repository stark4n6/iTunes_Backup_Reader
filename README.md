## Updates in Version 3

#### Version 3.1

* KAPE Support with updated module 
* IR Mode which automatically goes through drive and finds iTunes backups
* Bulk processing - Point at a directory of iTunes backups to read them all at once

#### Version 3.0

* Partial rewrite
* Now FULLY supports parsing unencrypted MBDB backups!
    * ex. You can now recreate file structures with older iTunes Backups
* Can now output to CSV, TXT or DB
* More detailed application reports
* More accurate timestamp labeling 
* Many bug fixes
* Still no support for decrypting backups :( 
* New name to more accurately describe what this tool is doing

*Big thanks to Tony Knutson @bigt252002 for helping me test and providing ideas and feedback on new features!*
 
## Updates in version 2.1
* Parses binary FRPD files to get the last connected computer names and usernames on the computer
* Sometimes when apps are sideloaded, they don't appear in "Applications", which has most the interesting data, but only in "Installed Applications" which only contains app's full name. Script now makes sure it gets those potentially sideloaded apps

## Updates in version 2.0
* Added support for recreating the file structure completely on unencrypted backups
* Added field for each installed application if they were possibly sideloaded
* More verbose logging
* Better exception handling
* Better KAPE implementation by separating backups into folders based on users
  
# Future Updates
* General code refactoring and optimizations
* Need larger datasets to be tested on

# Known Issues
* Problems with recreating file structure if NTFS long paths are not enabled
